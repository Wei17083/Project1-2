# Mathematical model for a spaceship to land on Titan

This project implements and visualizes a mathematical simulation of the motion of all celestial bodies in the solar system using Newton’s law of universal gravity and Euler, 4th order Runge-Kutta, and Verlet solver numerical methods. Moreover, a return mission to Titan is implemented using and comparing Hill climbing and Newton Rhapson algorithms for flying the spaceship and Open-Loop and Closed-Loop controllers for landing on Saturn’s moon.

## How to run

* Our Animation runs off the data stored in .csv files

* To generate the CSV files run testPhysics.java

* Once you have the CSV files start the animation run RunAnimation.java
